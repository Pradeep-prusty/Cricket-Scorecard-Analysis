## <b> The International Cricket Council (ICC) is the world governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from Australia, England and South Africa. It was renamed as the International Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current name in 1989. It organises world championship events such as Cricket World Cup, Women's Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup, ICC Women's T20 World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy and Under-19 Cricket World Cup.</b>

## <b> You recently got a lucky break in the field of Data Science. You got a job of Data Scientist at ICC. You are part of the Analytics Team which is involved in pre-match analyses, live-match analyses and post-match analyses. </b>

<br>

## <b>This data consists of 1417 T20 matches. Each row corresponds to a single T20 match. As a data scientist, you have to first explore the data and check its sanity. </b>

<br>

## <u><b>Further you are required to do some analyses:</b></u>
* ### Rename all the column names to their appropriate names, for example meta.created should be renamed as created_date
* ### Find out the top three venues which hosted the greatest number of matches.
* ### Find out the pair of cricket teams who played the most number of T20 matches against each other.
* ### Print the top five teams by their win percentages. Win percentage is defined as the number of matches won divided by the number of matches played and then multiplied by 100.
* ### Write a function to get the scorecard of each match. This function would take the innings value as argument and return two scorecard dataframes each for one team as shown below. So the first dataframe would contain the top 4 scorers of the team who batted first and the top 4 bowlers of the opponent team. And the second dataframe would contain the top 4 scorers of the team who batted second and the top 4 bowlers of the opponent team.
